# Practice React App

This is a small, basic app I used when learning react
  - Free free to leverage in any way to aid your learning/development process

Please keep in mind that the way things are implemented here aren't necessarily how they should be. Most components and files were built in a fairly unnecessarily modulated/complicated way to leverage different possible functions of react.


### How to use
Clone the repository & change directory
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/FrancescoAiello01/basic-react-practice.git
$ cd basic-react-practice
```
Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
